    "question": "What happens if a free hit delivery itself is bowled as a no-ball or wide?",
    "expected_answer": "If the free hit delivery itself is a no-ball or a wide, the free hit carries over to the subsequent delivery. The umpire signals the free hit again. This can cascade multiple times if consecutive no-balls or wides are bowled.",

    "expected_answer": "Each team gets 2 unsuccessful player reviews per innings. If the result of a review is 'umpire's call' (the on-field decision stands but is within an acceptable margin of uncertainty), the reviewing team does NOT lose their review.",

    "question": "What are the rules if a Super Over also ends in a tie in T20 International cricket?",
    "expected_answer": "If a Super Over ends in a tie, subsequent Super Overs are played until a winner is determined, with no limit on the number. Key rules for subsequent Super Overs: they must take place 5 minutes apart, the team that batted second bats first in the next one, any batter dismissed in a previous Super Over cannot bat again, and the bowler from the previous Super Over cannot bowl in the next one.",

    "question": "What is the in-match penalty for slow over rates in T20 International cricket?",
    "expected_answer": "If the fielding team fails to bowl their 20 overs within the allotted time (approximately 85 minutes), for every over not completed in time, the fielding team must bring one additional fielder inside the 30-yard circle for the remaining overs of the innings. This reduces their boundary protection, which is a significant disadvantage especially in the death overs.",
